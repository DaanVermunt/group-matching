# Genetic Algorithm for Weight-Max Grouping


## Features to implement
- Multicore usage (SPMD?)
- Avg/min/max fitness for every generation
- Old generation / new generation lists to prevent homogeneity
- Scoring participants based on agreed-upon algorithm instead of basic sum
- Ratings file (csv)
- showing final best grouping in graph
- Graph title includes best fitness achieved
